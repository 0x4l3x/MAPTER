# Master thesis - MAPTER: Mapping APTs through Embedding Representation

## Overview

MAPTER (Mapping APTs through Embedding Representation) is a modular framework developed to address the challenges posed by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in cybersecurity. APTs demand innovative approaches for effective detection and analysis, and MAPTER leverages machine learning-based binary code similarity detection to enhance understanding and enable defense measures against APTs.

## Abstract

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) present formidable challenges in the realm of cybersecurity, necessitating innovative methodologies for effective detection and analysis. This master's thesis introduces MAPTER (Mapping APTs through Embedding Representation), a modular framework designed to harness machine learning-based binary code similarity detection. The primary objective of MAPTER is to augment comprehension and enable proactive defense measures against APTs.

MAPTER integrates cutting-edge techniques from various disciplines to scrutinize APT malware. It leverages SAFE [1], a self-attentive deep learning model, to extract numerical representations from disassembled binary functions. These embeddings undergo dimensionality reduction techniques, enabling subsequent visual representation for targeted analysis.

The thesis proposes targeted analyses focused on specific APT groups. By exploring correlations among their binaries based on entry points and main functions, MAPTER provides insights into the origins, evolution, and behavior of APT groups.

To validate MAPTER's effectiveness, experiments are conducted on the APT19 group. Correlation analysis reveals significant similarities and shared functions, unveiling relationships and providing valuable insights.

In summary, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of cybersecurity by introducing a novel approach to APT analysis. The machine learning-based binary code similarity detection employed by MAPTER, coupled with its modular design, ensures adaptability to emerging technologies, incorporation of diverse datasets, and the development of targeted analysis approaches for specific APT families.

The insights gained through MAPTER empower defense strategies, enhance threat detection capabilities, and facilitate timely mitigation against APTs.
